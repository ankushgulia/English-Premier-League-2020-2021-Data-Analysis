# English Premier League 2020-2021 Data Analysis
 A Jupyter Notebook implementation to analyse the 2020-2021 season of the EPL.

In this project, I utilise the csv dataset uploaded in this repository. This dataset is a collection of basic but crucial stats of the English Premier League 2020-21 season. The dataset has all the players that played in the EPL and their standard stats such as Goals, Assists, xG (Expected Goals per match), xA (Expected Assists per match), Passes Attempted, Pass Accuracy and more.

At first, I analyize the dataset in terms of its information, description, null values, etc. Then, I carry out some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and find out important statistics such as total players in different age groups, players with the most yellow cards, etc. There is further work that can be  done on the dataset such as finding out which players had the most accurate passes excluding the goal keepers and defenders, teams with the highest penalty conversion ratio, etc.
